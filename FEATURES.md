# Features
In 0.4.9 and higher, you may enable additional features in Hybrid Bar, including experimental ones.

The non-experimental features listed are usually disabled for a variety of reasons:
- Compatibility concerns
- It may start background tasks which the user might not want
- The feature is slow and is generally not recommended using

## Standard Features

1. System Information via lxinfo (`systemd`)
   - Allows for calling aliases such as `%username%` which utilize libc calls over commands, which are typically faster
   - This is disabled by default because it relies on files such as `/etc/os-release` to be present on your system.
2. Hyprland Support (`hyprland`)
   - Adds the `%hl_workspace%` and `%hl_window%` aliases.
   - Workspace gets the current workspace id, whereas Window gets the focused window title.

## Experimental Features
> **Warning**: Experimental features are under development. They may break, change or be removed entirely.

1. System Tray (`tray_experimental`)
   - Introduced in version `0.4.4`, marked as experimental in version `0.4.6`
   - New widget: `tray` - using the `stray` crate
   - Not likely to become available as a stable feature anytime soon, because `stray` is overall hacky and a mess.
```json
{
   "left-tray_tray": {}
}
```
2. Rune Scripting (`rune_vm`)
   - Introduced in version `0.5.0`
   - Adds scripting support for Hybrid which will be expanded upon in the future.
   - To make it work, create a file called `main.rn` next to your `config.json` file.
```json
{
    "left-label_dynamic": {
        "update_rate": 300
    }
}
```
```rune
pub fn dynamic() { set_label_text("Hello!"); }
```
